# state-codes

Comprehensive Brazilian state code information, including ISO 3166-2:BR codes (the official 2-letter code abbreviations), IBGE state codes,  and "timelines" of each state creation. Provided as a Simple Data Format Data Package.

Strictly, each code designates an *federation unit* ("Unidade da Federação" - UF), that can be a  [state](https://schema.org/State) as usual  country-scale area segmentation, and can be also [capital districts and territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_districts_and_territories).
